% This function takes in two images and calculates the Pearson's
% correlation coefficient and Manders' coefficient.
% 
% The PEARSON'S coefficient is sensitive to noise and doesn't give a good
% estimate of colocalization if the stoichiometries are not 1:1 (if the
% signal in the images strongly colocalizes but the average intensities in
% the images are not equal, the Pearson's coefficient will underestimate
% colocalization). The coefficient varies between -1 and 1 (complete
% negative and positive correlation respectively, and 0 standing for no
% correlation).
% The MANDERS' coefficient is based on the Pearson's coefficient, but the
% mean intensities are taken out of the equation. The coefficient varies
% between 0 and 1 (standing for no or complete colocalization).
% The coefficient M1 is defined as the ratio of the 'summed intensities of
% pixels from the first image for which intensity in the other image is
% above zero' to the 'total intensity in the first image'. For M2, the
% images are switched.
