# Synaptosome-analysis

SynaptoAnalysis is a software package used to automatically detect, filter, and classify synaptosomes from single molecule localization data sets. The inputs for the software are single molecule localization data sets previously generated by localization software such as ThunderSTORM (Ovesny et al. 2011) or rapidSTORM (Wolter et al.). Two main scripts in the package are must be run to obtain results: Synapto_analysis.m, and compareConditions.m
